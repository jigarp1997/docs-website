Modern software is composed of thousands of components, and legacy security offerings don’t give security teams or individual developers the necessary insight to monitor and remediate vulnerabilities these components introduce.
With New Relic Vulnerability Management capability, your team’s engineers from DevOps, SREs, Infosec, and other teams can work together, share security information, identify vulnerabilities, and address risks at every stage of SDLC.
Security, thus becomes a teamsport and not the job of only one team.

With New Relic Vulnerability Management, you get:

* Birds-eye view of overall vulnerabilities - including the ones that are detected by New Relic platform and our integration partners such as FOSSA, AWS Security hub, Trivy, Snyk, Github Dependabot and others.
* Run time visibility of vulnerabilities that your applications or Infrastructure may experience (thus you can validate if a security patch has been deployed successfully!)
* Prioritisation feature helps you address the vulnerabilities that are urgent or matter the most.
* Triaging and remediation support.

Thus, you can overcome security blindspots across your entire software application and its associated infrastructure without reducing your team’s efficiency and without getting overwhelmed by the thousands and thousands of vulnerabilities that your teams may encounter.

{/* ## Monitor your vulnerabilities now

To get started:

1. Create a New Relic account to [start monitoring and remediating your vulnerabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/vulnerability-management).
2. Start [sending vulnerability data from our APM agents or third-party assessment tools](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/intro) or one of our agents.
